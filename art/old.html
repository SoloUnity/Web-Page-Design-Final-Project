			<p>The Great Wall of China is a wall built between over several centuries in order to fend off mongol invaders. The best known sections of the wall were built between the years 1368-1644 during the Ming dynasty. The walls themselves have stood the test of time remarkably well and are made from brick and a mortar which contains rice. This mortar is slightly flexible, allowing the wall to survive earthquaked and the test of time as it can shift to its environment. </p>
