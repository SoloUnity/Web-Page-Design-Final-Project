			<p>The skyline of Shanghai represents not only some of the best modern architecture China has to offer but also the financial and economic development of the country. With new skyscrapers such as the Shanghai tower, soaring above an impressive 600 meter, it is defined as a mega tall skyscraper. It is the second tallest building in the world and represents some of the best that China has to offer. What truly makes the city unique however, is the skyline at night. Entire districts will light up in a show of led lights displaying scenes from nature or of Chinese culture.</p>
