	<h3>Running: A Hobby</h3>

	<!-- WHEN -->
	<h3>Since When?</h3>
	<p>One of my hobbies and favourite sports is simply just running/jogging. I have been running as a sport ever since I was very little, all the way back in fourth grade, when I attended my first 1km race. At first, it was really just in school activities, but over time, I started doing it on my own free time. Over that past couple of years, I've regularly participated in Cross-Country competitions such as <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=372096">HALO</a> and have even started running on my own time.</p>
	
	<!-- WHY -->
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	I run for many reasons, some of which include:
	<ul>
		<li>It's healthy</li>
		<li>It relieves stress</li>				
	</ul>
	<!-- Healthy -->
	<p>Running being <b>healthy</b> is just an inherent thing to me. Not only does it improve your overall endurance and stamina, it also helps control your weight and BMI. Other benefits include that it helps clear the mind as you're only really concentrated on running and not on petty things. Of course, you will also get the benefits of being active, such as a lower chance of heart disease. Having a good endurance can translate well across other sports such as martial arts or badminton. </p>
    	
	<!-- STRESS -->
	<p>The <b>stress</b> relief benefits of running can't be overstated. As previously stated, running clears my mind. It also allows me to blow off steam since its a physical exercise. My favourite run is just a simple 2-3 km run just to breathe in some fresh air and to be able to go outside. However, in my opinion, running at dawn is the best for relieving stress. If you can run and see the sunset, it can be both breathtaking and inspiring.</p>
