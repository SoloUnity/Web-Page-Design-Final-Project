	<h3>Video Games: A Hobby</h3>

	<!-- WHEN -->
	<h3>Since When?</h3>
	<p>One of my hobbies and pastimes is playing video games. I have been playing ever since I was very little, all the way back in third grade. At first, it was really just iPad games, but over time, I discovered games on the computer. I found early on 2 games which I really liked, Minecraft and Starcraft, and ever since then I've been gaming to pass time and have fun. </p>
	
	<!-- WHY -->
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	I play video games for many reasons, some of which include:
	<ul>
		<li>It's fun</li>
		<li>It relieves stress</li>
		<li>I can be with friends</li>				
	</ul>
	<!-- FUN -->
	<p>Video games being <b>fun</b> is just an inherent thing to me. The fast paced intensive action really speaks to me, even if sometimes I can't keep up with it. The technical learning aspects of games also contributes to the amusing factor of it. It is very fulfilling when you learn a new technique or find a better more efficient method to function in the game. In some games, you can also play in a group or a team versus other players. This means that there's also a teamwork aspect to it where one relies on their respective teammates. This aspect of video games is what really elevates playing them as one of my all time favourite hobbies.</p>
    	
	<!-- STRESS -->
	<p>The <b>stress</b> relief benefits of video games can't be overstated. Sometimes, it's an intensive shooter game, allowing you to blow off steam. Other times, games can be relaxing, such as in Minecraft where there is no real end goal, and you pass your time by building, exploring and discovering! Either way, they are both ways to relieve stress and to wind down. (Even if it doesn't seem like it to my mom)</p>
	
	<!-- FRIENDS -->
	<p>Finally, video games helps me bond with <b>friends</b>. As I previously mentioned, games can be played in both solo and team modes. This allows for a pretty big combination of competition provided a lot of your friends also play the game. This aspect is especially good in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. Being able to have fun, bond and talk to your friends over a game online does wonders for your mental health. It's also great since you never actually physically meet your friends in person, meaning that there is no risk of getting covid. (: .</p>
